    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I think this gets credit as my <em>gateway drug</em> into the world of home bread baking. It's so simple and mostly hands off that it made it seem possible to stop buying disappointing bread from the grocery store.</p>
    <p>There are lots of versions out there, but I always tended to use Mark Bittman's recipe.</p>
   
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>bread flour</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>yeast</li>
        <li>water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>stir together ingredients</li>
        <li>cover and leave bowl on counter overnight</li>
        <li>loosely form a ball and let rest while oven preheats</li>
        <li>preheat oven and covered dutch oven</li>
        <li>carefully dump the bread in the dutch oven and close the lid</li>
        <li>when done, remove to cooling rack...don't burn tongue on steamy bread!</li>
    </ol>
