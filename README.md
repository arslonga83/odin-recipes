# odin-recipes

Project #1 in The Odin Project journey. Purpose is to demonstrate basic HTML construction by building a few recipe pages all linked to an index. 

By the end of the project, I feel pretty confident with all elements used. The file tree can still be a little mysterious and my main issues were getting the images to link correctly, but it was pretty easy to troubleshoot. Will definitely get easier with repetition!
